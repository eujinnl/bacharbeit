\addsec{Abstract}
Numerous studies have been conducted to discover educational technologies that could be utilised to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding of fundamental programming
concepts. The advantage that various online programming
learning platforms provide, is immediate feedback and
automated guidance with the completion of assignments,
enhancing student comprehension. Despite the various
advantages of online learning environments, the lack of online
persistence is viewed as one of the most pervasive disadvantages.
Gamification of online learning environments have been
proposed as a solution to enhance student engagement, and
persistence, but little research has focused on how specific
gamification elements influence the persistent use of online
programming learning environments. The aim of this study was
therefore to fill this gap and to determine what influence various
gamification elements have on the persistent use of an online
programming learning platform.
